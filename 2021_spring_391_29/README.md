# Intro to AI Project 2
Implementing A* search in SEPIA

## Experience with API
Our group thinks it would be nice if the API were documented more clearly of how the enemyBlockerAgent should be added to the project for dynamic map to work properly. If would also be helpful if the API documented how to setup Sepia outside of Eclipse. Otherwise, the API was useful.

# Intro to AI Project 3
Project implements minimax alpha beta search using Sepia. Our group became more familiar with the API and was more fluent with using its methods. If the API described how the archer attack works, it would be helpful.
